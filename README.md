# tirecovery
A port of libirecovery to the TI-84 Pus CE

To use, just include the .h and .c in your src folder.
USB-C devices are a little finicky on the calculator.
Serial is not supported, probably due to the power output of the calculator's USB port not being enough for the serial interface spec.
